# üì± Simply Ebay - Mobile App Development Plan
*Transform web app into a fully functional iOS & Android mobile application*

## üéØ Project Overview

**Vision**: Create "Simply Ebay" - a mobile app that uses AI-powered camera recognition to instantly identify items, provide eBay price estimates, and enable one-tap listing with target reticles overlay.

**Current State**: Web application with basic eBay integration and Google Vision API
**Target State**: Native mobile app for iOS and Android with real-time camera AI recognition

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

### Core Technology Stack
- **Mobile Framework**: React Native (for cross-platform development)
- **AI/Computer Vision**: 
  - Primary: On-device TensorFlow Lite models
  - Fallback: Google Vision API for complex recognition
- **Backend**: Supabase (existing infrastructure)
- **eBay Integration**: eBay API (existing)
- **Real-time Processing**: WebRTC for camera streaming
- **State Management**: Redux Toolkit
- **Navigation**: React Navigation 6

### Mobile-Specific Requirements
- **Camera Integration**: Real-time video processing
- **AR Overlay**: Target reticles with price display
- **Offline Capability**: Cached AI models for basic recognition
- **Push Notifications**: Price alerts and listing updates
- **Biometric Auth**: Face ID / Touch ID / Fingerprint

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack (Simplified)

**Existing Working Components:**
- ‚úÖ Web app with camera functionality
- ‚úÖ Google Vision API integration  
- ‚úÖ eBay API for pricing
- ‚úÖ Supabase backend
- ‚úÖ Image upload/processing

**Mobile Additions Needed:**
- PWA manifest for app-like experience
- Mobile-optimized CSS
- Touch controls for reticles
- Offline caching

---

## ÔøΩ Budget Reality Check

**Actual Cost**: $0 - $500 max
- Domain/hosting: $20/year
- Apple Developer account: $99/year (optional, can use PWA)
- Google Play Console: $25 one-time (optional, can use PWA)
- Total: ~$150 max

**What we DON'T need:**
- ‚ùå React Native rewrite
- ‚ùå Months of development
- ‚ùå Team of developers
- ‚ùå $150K budget
- ‚ùå App store approval process (PWA works fine)

---

## üéØ Success Metrics (Realistic)

- [ ] Camera works on mobile browsers
- [ ] AI recognition displays results
- [ ] Price estimates show up
- [ ] Users can tap to create eBay listings
- [ ] App installs from home screen (PWA)

---

## ÔøΩ Next Steps (Today)

1. [ ] Test current web app on mobile device
2. [ ] Add mobile viewport meta tag
3. [ ] Create simple reticle overlay
4. [ ] Add PWA manifest file
5. [ ] Deploy and test

**Reality Check**: Your app already works! You just need to add the reticles and mobile polish.

## üöÄ Immediate Actions (Today)

Let's test what you have right now:

1. Open your web app on a mobile device
2. Test the camera functionality  
3. Verify AI recognition works
4. Check eBay price suggestions

**If those work, you're 90% done.** Just need to add:
- Target reticles over detected objects
- Mobile-optimized UI
- PWA manifest for app installation

**Timeline**: 3 days max
**Budget**: Under $500  
**Result**: Fully functional mobile app ready for users
